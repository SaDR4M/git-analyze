🤖 Git Analyzer
A simple desktop app built with Python to analyze my GitHub activity with the help of AI. This is a personal project focused on learning how to gain better insights into my own coding habits.

Note: The GUI for this project was designed and built with the assistance of an AI.

🎯 What It Does
The main idea is to use AI to:

Analyze commit messages: Get tips on how to write better, clearer commits.

See an activity overview: Track what I've accomplished daily, monthly, or yearly.

(Future Goal) Get code feedback: Eventually, have an AI analyze my code and suggest improvements and best practices.
